In shadows deep, where wild hearts quake,
Beneath the weight of mankind's wake,
Innocent eyes meet cruel fate's decree,
As pain and sorrow grip each plea.

Yet in the hearts of those who see,
A sanctuary born, a refuge free,
For creatures battered, broken, torn,
A haven found, where hope is sworn.

To those who tend with gentle hand,
To creatures of the earth and sand,
Reward is due for love untold,
True nature's stewards, brave and bold.
